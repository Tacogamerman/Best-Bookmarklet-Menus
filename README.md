# Update:
Added a bookmarklet menu I made which contains all of the menus (And some other scripts I made) together.

If any of the buttons on it don't work on a site, drag them to your bookmarks bar.
They are also all stored in one clean ui.
# This repo contains 200+ bookmarklets!

This is a collection of all the best bookmarklet menus, some of them even contain over 50 bookmarklets!
